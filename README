qbpos-schema
============

This is a DBIx::Class schema for the quickbooks pos database.  Use at your own risk
this is more of an test project than anything that shouild be considered for production.

This schema is based on quickbooks pos v 8.0

# Usage:
At this point I am supporting using DBI::Proxy connection to ODBC using the QODBC driver.
The speed of this will mostl likely be very slow and it's intent is more for data syncing
inventory, customer and sales orders data.
